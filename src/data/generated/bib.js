        "abstract": "The IoT, as the latest information technology, is expected to support the ubiquitous connectivity of anything, anytime and anywhere. Since numerous IoT devices will be connected to cellular networks, the conflicting demands of ultra-low latency, massive connectivity and high reliability impose significant burdens on the operational wireless networks. Exploiting various temporarily unused computational and storage resources by invoking cooperative caching and computing has the potential of supporting these demanding applications. One of the key characteristics of next-generation networks is the boom of applications in social networking. By exploiting the benefits of social networking, the burdens imposed on wireless networks by the IoT applications can be mitigated by the proposed caching assisted collaborative computing IoT framework.",

        "abstract": "Body Sensor Networks (BSNs) have emerged as the most effective technology enabling not only new e-Health methods and systems but also novel applications in human-centered areas such as electronic health care, \ufb01tness/welness systems, sport performance monitoring, interactive games, factory workers monitoring, and social physical interaction. Despite their enormous potential, they are currently mostly used only to monitor single individuals. Indeed, BSNs can proactively interact and collaborate to foster novel BSN applications centered on collaborative groups of individuals. In this paper, C-SPINE, a framework for Collaborative BSNs (CBSNs), is proposed. CBSNs are BSNs able to collaborate with each other to ful\ufb01ll a common goal. They can support the development of novel smart wearable systems for cyberphysical pervasive computing environments. Collaboration therefore relies on interaction and synchronization among the CBSNs and on collaborative distributed computing atop the collaborating CBSNs. Speci\ufb01cally, collaboration is triggered upon CBSN proximity and relies on service-speci\ufb01c protocols allowing for managing services among the collaborating CBSNs. C-SPINE also natively supports multi-sensor data fusion among CBSNs to enable joint data analysis such as \ufb01ltering, time-dependent data integration and classi\ufb01cation. To demonstrate its effectiveness, C-SPINE is used to implement e-Shake, a collaborative CBSN system for the detection of emotions. The system is based on a multisensor data fusion schema to perform automatic detection of handshakes between two individuals and capture of possible heart-rate-based emotion reactions due to the individuals\u2019 meeting.",

First, the architecture of a personalized customized production system used for implementing the TCCD method is presented. Then, according to the number and type of products in the customer order received from the private cloud platform, the customer\u2019s personalized customized order is dynamically divided. Subsequently, a task priority sorting algorithm is proposed to optimize the waiting time of all tasks involved in the order. Furthermore, a discrete particle swarm algorithm is proposed to optimize the average execution time of all tasks and equipment utilization decision-making options (thing-edge collaborative computing, edge-edge collaborative computing, or edge-cloud collaborative computing).

The proposed model for collaborative and adaptive multimedia content delivery will provide the mobile learners with cloud\u00ad based services. These services will facilitate the delivery of the preferred multimedia content across heterogeneous network to various types of mobile devices that learners are using.

        "abstract": "Mobile bike-sharing services have been prevalently used in many cities as an important urban commuting service and a promising way to build smart cities, especially in the new era of 5G and Internet-of-Things (IoT) environments. A mobile bike-sharing service makes commuting convenient for people and imparts new vitality to urban transportation systems. In the real world, the problems of no docks or no bikes at bike-sharing stations often arise because of several inevitable reasons such as the uncertainty of bike usage. In addition to pure manual rebalancing, in several works, attempts were made to predict the demand for bikes. In this paper, we devised a bike-sharing service with highly accurate demand prediction using collaborative computing and information fusion. We combined the information of bike demands at different time periods and the locations between stations and proposed a dynamical clustering algorithm for station clustering. We carefully analyzed and discovered the group of features that impact the demand of bikes, from historical bike-sharing records and 5G IoT environment data. We combined the discovered information and proposed an XGBoost-based regression model to predict the rental and return demand. We performed suf\ufb01cient experiments on two real-world datasets. The results con\ufb01rm that compared to some existing methods, our method produces superior prediction results and performance and improves the availability of bike-sharing service in 5G IoT environments.",
